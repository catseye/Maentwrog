The Maentwrog Programming Language
==================================

This is the reference distribution for the Maentwrog programming language,
designed and implemented in 1993.

This distribution contains the reference interpreter, written in ANSI C, a
rudimentary specification document, and some example Maentwrog programs.

It also contains a few other miscellaneous contemporaneous C programs by
the author, for historical interest.

The specification and example programs in this distribution were
taken from the esolangs.org wiki page for Maentwrog that was written by
User:Marinus.  Thanks Marinus!

All of these materials are in the public domain.

The current released version of the Maentwrog distribution is
version 1.1 revision 2018.0608.
